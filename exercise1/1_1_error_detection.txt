number of delimeters: the numbers of delimeters are not the same for each line
- header got 17 semicolons, but lines 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 have 18 \
and line 12 20 semicolons
+ add semicolons for missing value

different annotations for "missing values": it seems that there were used two different kinds \ 
of values for annotating "missing values" on column "F-Mccc-1/F-RLoc".
- empty cells and cells with value 0 in column "F-Mccc-1/F-RLoc"
+ fill empty cells with 0 or remove 0

inconsistent annotations for one value: in column "IsGenerated" the value "Yes" exists in two \
ways ("Yes" and "yes").
- yes
+ Yes

wrong values in column: in Column IsGenerated there are values that do not make semantic sense. \
The column name "IsGenerated" implies boolean values but also got numerical values.
- 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4 
+ change n =< O to No and n>0 to Yes?

missing header file: one header file probably be used for multiplce c or/and cpp files.
- source/liblocate/include/liblocate/liblocate.h
+ include another header file
